Just note that, for some reason, the extension works much better than the bookmarklet. :(\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nUsing HyperTyper is extremely simple; all you need to do is go to one of the [supported websites](#supported-websites) and click on the checkered flag that appears in your Omnibar (if you're using the Chrome extension) or click on the bookmarklet to start up HyperTyper. Now (once the first word of the passage is in the input box) press space to #HyperType.\r\n\r\nIf you're too lazy to press space 500 times, I wrote a use this bash script to press space 600 times. To use it with HyperTyper, first run HyperTyper (click on the icon or bookmarklet), run the script, then get to the input field, and watch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#! /bin/bash\r\nsleep 3;\r\nfor ((i=0; i < 600; i++))\r\n  do\r\n    xte 'key space'undefined \r\n  done\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt requires a package called [Xautomation](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xautomation/files/xautomation/) to work. Fortunately, it's in the repositories for most distros, so you can probably install it using your package manager.\r\n\r\nUsing apt:`$ sudo apt-get install Xautomation`\r\n\r\nUsing pacman:`$ sudo pacman -S xautomation`\r\n\r\nFor other package managers, see Xautomation's Sourceforge page.\r\n\r\n### Supported Websites\r\n\r\n*   [TypeRacer](http://play.typeracer.com): real-time racing against real people.\r\n*   [10FastFingers](http://10fastfingers.com): testing and competetitions with daily leaderboards.\r\n*   [Typing Speed Contest](http://typingspeedcontest.com): minute long typing test with PERMANANENT (and #HyperTyped) leaderboards!\r\n*   [typrX](http://app.typrX.com): real-time racing, less popular than TypeRacer.\r\n\r\nYour favorite typing competition site - [??](https://github.com/ethanmad/HyperTyper/issues/new)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with HyperTyper?
